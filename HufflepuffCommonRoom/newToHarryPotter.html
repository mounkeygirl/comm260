          <h1>New to Harry Potter?</h1>

          <h2>Harry Potter is a book series created by J.K. Rowling </h2>
          <p> Harry potter is a series of 7 books written by JK Rowling between the years 1997 and 2007.

            <h2>The Basic Setup</h2>
            <p>The main Character, Harry Potter, is living with his aunt and uncle, who adore their own spoiled son Dudly but dispise Harry.
            One day Harry gets a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a seven year boarding school for witches and wizards between roughly 11 and 18.
            As soon as Harry starts to interact with the secrect wizarding world it becomes apparent that he's famous there, even though he'd had no previous knowlage about it.
            As a baby he had somehow countered an attack by the dark wizard Voldemort, which had severly weakened the dark wizard and sent him into hidding, leaving Harry himself with a lightning bolt scar as a souviner of the encounter.
            Over the course of the series Harry attends class and learns how to do magic with his friends Ron and Hermonie, all the while getting tangled up in events surrounding Voldemort's reclaimation of power.

            <h2>How does the Hufflepuff Commonroom fit into this?</h2>
            <p>
              At Hogwarts, on the first day new students arrive they go through a sorting ceremony. Here they are put into one of the four "Houses", Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slyterin. They then reside in the House dorms for their seven year stay and take classes with others in their House. The way it's decided how which house they go into is each student sits on a stool in front of the student body on puts on The Sorting Hat, which reads their mind to look for traits that each house values.
              <br>Many readers of the series pick a house they consider themselves part of, based on their own personality and values.
              <br>Hufflepuff is the house that values loyalty, hardwork, and kindness.
              <br>Gryffindor values bravery.
              <br>Ravenclaw values cleverness.
              <br>Slyterin values ambition.
